# This code defines two Pydantic models: Address and Patient, where Patient includes a nested Address model. It creates and prints a patient instance with structured address data.


# What are Nested Models?

# Nested models in Pydantic are models used as fields inside other models. In this example:
# Address is a model with fields: city, state, and pin.
# Patient includes an address field, which is of type Address.
# This allows for cleaner, reusable, and more organized data structures, especially when dealing with complex or hierarchical data like user profiles, locations, or configurations.


# Better organization of related data (e.g., vitals, address, insurance)
# Reusability: Use Vitals in multiple models (e.g., Patient, MedicalRecord)
# Readability: Easier for developers and API consumers to understand
# Validation: Nested models are validated automaticallyâ€”no extra work needed
